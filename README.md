**Developing a  Computer Game for Industrial Engineering**

UPRM Gaming - Virtual Factory 2.0 is latest version of a  serious game that has been in development in recent years. The  research project started in 2009 and  has been sponsored  by the National Science Foundation (NSF) since its beginning. Many have been the people, among UPRM faculty members and students, who have collaborated to make this project possible.  We invite you to learn more about the game and its purpose by reading the research's basic  overview that follows.

**Innovations in Engineering Education, Curriculum and Infrastructure (IEECI)**

Can Gaming Provide Enough Context to Improve Knowledge Integration and Retention in Engineering Freshman?

*Need*

Visual stimuli and games capture the attention of Generation Y learners. However, this reality has not been formally addressed by U.S. engineering program curricula. Little work has been done to test to what extent serious game, when introduced in the first semester of engineering, provide context to the learning that needs to occur for a freshman persist to graduation; help students incorporate this experience into knowledge acquired in following semesters, and ultimately, improve retention.

*Approach*

Develop computer-based serious game where students interact with a virtual world to improve a system using Industrial Engineering (IE) techniques. Use the game as a tool to assess how serous games improve retention and motivation of freshman IE students; support learning in context; improve student understanding of core concepts; and improve problem-solving skills in complex unstructured problems.

*Benefits*

Improve retention and motivation of IE freshman students; support learning in context; improve students understanding of core concepts; improve problem-solving skills in complex unstructured problems; gain an understanding of how engineering students learn concepts and develop skills through educational games.
